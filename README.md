# Housing Price Detection Dataset ~ Kaggle(link error) based on a UK housing dataset
firstly I did EDA(pre processing and VIF ) on the dataset before making the the model so that the processed data makes the minimum errors during prediction and and later on LR(Linear Regression) model to predict housing price .
